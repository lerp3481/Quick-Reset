TODO list (no particular order):

(Things regarding this program should be tagged with [P], and things regarding the website should be tagged with [W])

- [W] Just make the website catch up with the program, you know? I want to be able to access the drill on my phone too

- [P] Great, we can play the drill. Can we stop it though?
- [P] Start animation at any set
- [P] Adjust performer label text size (and perhaps other settings like color and boldness as well)
- [P] Edit field excess stuff in the FieldSettingsPanel
- [P] Perhaps play the show music along with the drill?
- [P] Fix the dot books to draw dots that go beyond the field bounds
- [P] Add the count slider, and the count input (so you can view the picture at a specific count)
- [P] Reposition the performer labels to make them easier to read (Pyware does it above or below the dot (below by default))
